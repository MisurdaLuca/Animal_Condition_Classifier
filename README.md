# 🐾 Animal Condition Classifier – AI for Animal Risk Assessment

**Status:** Finished
**University Project** – Óbuda University, BSc in Computer Engineering  
**Subject:** Machine Learning / AI specialization

## 📘 Overview

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model that can classify animals based on visual risk categories: **dangerous** or **non-dangerous**.

The goal is to demonstrate how artificial intelligence and computer vision can assist in **automatic safety assessments**, potentially for surveillance, wildlife monitoring, or security systems.

The system uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process images and assign them to one of two classes.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python** – primary programming language  
- **TensorFlow / Keras** – deep learning framework  
- **OpenCV** – image preprocessing and augmentation  
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualization of metrics  
- **Scikit-learn** – classification evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)

## 🎓 Educational Context

This project was developed as part of the **AI specialization** in the **Computer Engineering BSc program** at **Óbuda University**, under the course focusing on deep learning and image classification.

It demonstrates practical application of CNNs to binary classification problems in safety-critical domains.

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available **Animal Disease Dataset** from Kaggle:
