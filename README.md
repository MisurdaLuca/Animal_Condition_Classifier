# 🐾 Animal Condition Classifier – AI for Animal Risk Assessment

## 👋🏼 Welcome to my project work!

This repository is part of a semester-long assignment for the **Machine Learning** course at the **University of Óbuda**, within the **Artificial Intelligence specialization**.

The project consisted of an Ai model that classifies 5 animal disease symptoms into two categories (dangerous or non-dangerous).<br>The task was particularly challenging as it required significant data cleaning.

## 📂 Dataset

This project uses the publicly available **Animal Disease Dataset** from Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracehephzibahm/animal-disease](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gracehephzibahm/animal-disease)

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Python** – primary programming language  
- **Streamlit** - deploy
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** – visualization of metrics  
- **Scikit-learn** – classification evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, etc.)
- **NLTK** (WordNet) – synonym detection and semantic filtering
- **Sentence Transformers** – embedding-based similarity for synonym elimination
